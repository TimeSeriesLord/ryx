    ;; if it is a file or url, read it as that returns a string!

    ;; this puts csv data into strings, which defeats the power
    ;; of Carl Sassenrath's REBOL design co-opted by Red
    csv: load-csv feed

    ;; so rebolize it, i.e., turn string values 
    ;; into REBOL / Red values
    ;; Rebolized is named in honor of Carl Sassenrath
