easyr help

Add functions to easyr object. So we need to prototype descend from a base easyr object called maybe ebase that has the cloned functions

we're back to object extend

grow: make function! [[
    {Extend an object, map, or block type with word and value pair.}
    obj [object! map! block! paren!] "object to extend (modified)"
    word [any-word!]
    val
][
    if :val [append obj reduce [to-set-word word :val]]
    :val
]]
