Let's convert the hex code #FF0000 to RGB:

Separate the hex code: Red = FF, Green = 00, Blue = 00
Convert hex pairs to decimal: Red (FF) = 255, Green (00) = 0, Blue (00) = 0 (using the conversion table)
RGB values: (255, 0, 0) (represents pure red)
Normalized RGB (optional):

Red: 255 / 255 = 1.0
Green: 0 / 255 = 0.0
Blue: 0 / 255 = 0.0

1. Separate the Hex Code:

A hex color code is typically a 6-digit string representing the red, green, and blue components of a color.
For example, the hex code #FF0000 represents red at its maximum value (FF), green at its minimum value (00), and blue at its minimum value (00).
2. Convert Each Hex Pair to Decimal:

Each pair of hex digits corresponds to a single RGB color component (red, green, or blue).
Convert each two-digit hex value (e.g., FF, 00) to its decimal equivalent using the standard base-16 conversion system. You can use a calculator or online conversion tools for this step.
