Rxy is a thinking environment, a powerful tool designed to enhance problem-solving. 

Rxy exists for problem solvers, you know, data analysts, academic researchers, businesswomen, for anyone who uses computers solve problems in terms of data and data transformation. 

Input, transformation, output â€” that is what it is all about. 

Genius Chuck Moore championed the idea solving problems by combining words to achieve complex functionality when he created Forth. Chuck's approach inspires Rxy!

Rxy lets you be expressive and results-oriented.  Over time, with Rxy, you will create a problem-solving language that reflects on how you think. 

Because it rides atop Red and the Red Language Interpreter (RLI), Rxy leverages the amazing full-stack programming language created by Nenad Rakocevic, himself inspired by the genius of Carl Sassenrath and his REBOL.

Follow the directory naming conventions and with a couple of tweaks at start-up, Rxy will automagically incorporate your problem-solving vocabulary into its dictionary. 

Where you go from there, that will be up to you. 

# Rxy at the Start!

When Rxy starts up, it looks to load words. Already it loads hundreds beyond what comes with the RLI. 

As long as you put your files under Rxy in a named directory (folder) and with a couple of code tweaks, Rxy will load ever-growing problem-solving book of words. This way, you can get right to problem-solving.
