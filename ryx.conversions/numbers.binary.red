	comment { 
		red uses its own internal representation for binary data
		>> to-binary 1
		== #{00000001}

		so we need to use built-in enbase function 
		to encode a string into a binary-coded string using base 2
		since (BASE-64 default) 

		because red returns a zero padded string, presumably as 
		placeholders for binary representation based on memory,
		we need to strip those to return an integer in a 
		binary number "layout"

		also, built in to-integer is too smart so we don't need to
		strip those 0s by code:

		but red does not support integers beyond a size
		hence large strings must stay as strings

	}

	;; encode it as a binary string
	bin: enbase/base to-binary int 2

	;; return an integer in the supported range
	if all [int > -1 int <= 1023]  [
		return to-integer bin
	]
	;; otherwise return a string representation without
	;; leading zeroes
	while [ 
		#"0" = first bin
	][
		pop bin

    return bin
