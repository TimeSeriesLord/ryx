nBase is a data base management tool that allows easy manipulation of small
and medium sized data bases using English-like commands. 

SORTING THE DATA BASE FILE
With so few employees, it's easy to find the record of any given person. But suppose
the company had 500 or 5000 employees. It would be hard to find a particular
employee's record if the records were in random order as they are here. 

So sort the file into alphabetical order and store the results in a new file named ABCORDER
by entering the SORT command as follows:


sort on name to abcorder 

1. first row is header
2. remaining rows are data that must match the header
